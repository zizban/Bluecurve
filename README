This is a port of Red Hat's Bluecurve theme to recent versions of GNOME and current versions of MATE.

www.mate-desktop.org

This package contains:

Bluecurve Icon Theme from the Red Hat Art project.

BlueCurve Metacity Theme from Fedora Project.

Bluecurve-Clearlooks 0.5.2

www.gnome-look.org

I only changed one line in the Bluecurve-Looks theme to make it work with MATE. It does not effect how it works with GNOME.

Tested with GNOME 2.28 and up.

Tested with MATE 1.1

INSTALL

After unpacking the main tarball, drag and drop included tarballs to the GNOME/MATE Appearence prefernce panel.
